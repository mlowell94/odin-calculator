A calculator made with JavaScript as the final project for TOP's Foundations section.

I have never had to think so hard about anything in my life. Overall this took me maybe 10 total hours of work to build. The hardest part was trying to figure out 
how to evaluate numbers if there's already two ready for calculation and the user presses another operator. I think I wasted a lot of time trying to brute force a solution using arrays (I am weak
when it comes to understanding arrays but I really want to do more with them), but ultimately I just settled on having two variables for the operands. I'm pleased with this. It's far from perfect but 
to the best of my knowledge it only stops working as intended if the user is deliberately trying to stop it from working as intended. Even then, they can reset it with the AC button. Fun project, but a reminder
of where I'm weakest.
